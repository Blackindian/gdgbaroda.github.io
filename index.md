## Welcome to GDG Baroda

Google Developers Group Baroda is a technology user group that meets to discuss the latest Google
Technologies, Tools, SDKs, and APIs. The focus is on learning about the broad spectrum of technologies
provided by Google and finding ways that these technologies can be applied. This includes discussions of
the technologies from a number of angles (start ups, corporations, and individuals).
